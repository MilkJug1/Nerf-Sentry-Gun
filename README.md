# Nerf-Sentry-Gun
An object tracking Nerf Sentry Gun
Forked from BuckarewBanzai

Uses OpenCv, Numpy, and Yolov3

Download Yolov3 weights since the file is way too big to put in the repo (Make sure to download YOLOv3-320 weights since it was built on this!)

I will try to see if this works on a raspberry pi 4, so that you can build a Nerf sentry gun
